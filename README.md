# hello-world
My first respository!

Passinated of music, I'd like to create an *Odd Calculator* which, given a set of data, will calculate what are the odds that 2 songs
of a same album to play back to back in a shuffled Spotify playlist. 

I'd also like to create a *Song Analyser* that will tell me (again, given a set of data and rules) how many songs in a playlist are fitting
given rules.
